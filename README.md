# GitHub Feed Blacklist

## What is the script for?

As a team player, you work closely with your colleagues. Along the way, youâ€™ll find reliable folks who become friends, and others who youâ€™d rather not see again ðŸ˜…. On GitHub, blocking a user might affect collaboration, and thatâ€™s not our style. We donâ€™t mix personal feelings with work, but we also donâ€™t want certain people popping up in our GitHub feed. Itâ€™s a problem of GitHub not distinguishing between work and personal boundaries and lacking user understanding in their content push. Iâ€™m not satisfied with their product design, so I wrote this script.

## How to use it?

> Note that you need to install the Tampermonkey extension first before clicking the link to install script.

[Install Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helsonxiao/github-feed-blacklist/master/script.user.js)

Once everything is set up, visit github.com and set up a blacklist in the developer tools console. For example:

```js
localStorage.setItem("feed-blacklist", JSON.stringify(["username"]));
```

Hereâ€™s to smooth work and happy living! ðŸŽ‰
